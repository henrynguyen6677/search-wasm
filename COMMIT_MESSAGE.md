feat: migrate to ViteJS with complete frontend/backend separation

This is a major refactoring that completely separates the frontend and 
backend codebases while migrating from static files to a modern ViteJS 
build system.

## üéØ Major Changes

### Frontend Migration to ViteJS
- Migrated from static HTML/JS serving to ViteJS build system
- Added modern development workflow with HMR and fast refresh
- Integrated TailwindCSS via PostCSS instead of CDN
- Implemented ES modules with proper import/export system
- Added Web Worker support with Vite's module system

### Complete Frontend/Backend Separation
- Moved ALL frontend code to `frontend/` directory
- Created completely independent frontend project with own configs
- Separated `src/` (Rust only) from `frontend/` (JS/CSS/HTML only)
- Eliminated mixed file types in Rust source directory
- Zero build system conflicts between cargo and npm

### Project Structure Reorganization
- `src/` ‚Üí Pure Rust code only (.rs files)
- `frontend/` ‚Üí Complete Vite project (HTML, JS, CSS, configs)
- `pkg/` ‚Üí WASM files (generated from Rust)
- `dist/` ‚Üí Production build output
- Root level ‚Üí Rust project configs only

### Technical Improvements
- Fixed WASM import issues with proper ES module paths
- Optimized build process with tree-shaking and minification
- Added proper TypeScript support preparation
- Implemented modern CSS preprocessing pipeline
- Enhanced development experience with professional tooling

## üîß Files Changes

### Added
- `frontend/package.json` - NPM dependencies and scripts
- `frontend/vite.config.js` - Vite configuration with WASM support
- `frontend/tailwind.config.js` - TailwindCSS configuration
- `frontend/postcss.config.js` - PostCSS configuration
- `frontend/index.html` - HTML entry point for Vite
- `frontend/main.js` - Main application logic (from www/index.js)
- `frontend/worker.js` - Web Worker with ES modules
- `frontend/style.css` - TailwindCSS styles
- `frontend/README.md` - Frontend-specific documentation
- `FINAL_STRUCTURE_V2.md` - Updated project structure docs

### Modified
- Updated import paths for WASM modules
- Fixed CSS import order to eliminate warnings
- Enhanced UI with better progress tracking
- Improved error handling and user feedback

### Removed
- Root-level frontend configs (moved to frontend/)
- `public/pkg/` - Fixed Vite import restrictions
- Mixed JS/CSS files from `src/` directory

## üöÄ Benefits

### Developer Experience
- Hot Module Replacement for instant feedback
- Professional IDE support without language server conflicts
- Clear separation of concerns and responsibilities
- Scalable architecture for team development

### Build & Performance
- Modern bundle optimization with tree-shaking
- Automatic CSS purging and minification
- Proper asset handling and optimization
- Production-ready build pipeline

### Maintainability
- Enterprise-grade project organization
- Self-contained frontend with own dependencies
- Zero interference between Rust and JS build systems
- Clear migration path for future enhancements

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

```bash
# Rust development (at root)
cargo build
wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir pkg

# Frontend development
cd frontend/
npm install
npm run dev     # Development server
npm run build   # Production build
npm run preview # Preview build
```

This refactoring establishes a professional, scalable foundation for 
the RipGrep-Lite WASM project with best practices for polyglot 
development.
